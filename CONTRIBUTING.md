### Bug reports and feature requests

If you have a bug to report or a feature to request, please [fill an issue](link to add).


### New features, improvements, bug fixes or changes to existing features

If you want to contribute, navigate to the ["issues" tab](link to add) and start looking through interesting issues. If you are not sure of where to start, then start by trying one of the smaller/easier issues here i.e. [issues with the "good first issue" label](link to add).

If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so we and other people know that you're working on it, we will be happy to help.
